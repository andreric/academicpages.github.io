2017-01-01	Spatial Projection of Multiple Climate Variables Using Hierarchical Multitask Learning	AAAI'17	This paper proposes a new Hierarchical Multitask Learning framework for the joint prediction of multiple climate variables. Each task in this multitask learning set up is actually another multitask learning problem.

2016-01-01	Multi-task sparse structure learning with gaussian copula models	JMLR	This paper presents a novel family of models for MTL, applicable to regression and classification problems, capable of learning the structure of tasks relationship via Copula distributions.

2018-06-01	Modeling Alzheimer's disease cognitive scores using multi-task sparse group lasso	Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (Journal)	We consider the problem of simultaneously predicting several different cognitive scores associated with categorizing subjects as normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a multi-task learning framework using features extracted from brain images obtained from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)	X Liu, AR Goncalves, P Cao, D Zhao, A Banerjee	paper-group-lasso	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611117301076
2017-09-01	 On the generalization of fused systems in voice presentation attack detection	16th International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group	This paper describes presentation attack detection systems developed for the Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge (ASVspoof 2017). The submitted systems, using calibration and score fusion techniques, combine different sub-systems (up to 18), which are based on eight state of the art features and rely on Gaussian mixture models and feed-forward neural network classifiers.

2017-08-01	 Structured Estimation in High Dimensions and Multitask Learning with Applications in Climate	Large-Scale Machine Learning in the Earth Sciences (Book Chapter)	 We discuss structured sparse regression and multitask models for data analysis in climate science.

2015-06-27	Multi-Label Structure Learning with Ising Model Selection.	 IJCAI'15	 Built on recent advances in structure learning in Ising Markov Random Fields (I-MRF), we propose a multi-label classification algorithm that explicitly estimate and incorporate label dependence into the classifiers learning process by means of a sparse convex multitask learning formulation.

2014-11-3	Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning	CIKM'14	In this paper, we present a novel family of models for MTL, applicable to regression and classification problems, capable of learning the structure of task relationships. In particular, we consider a joint estimation problem of the task relationship structure and the individual task parameters, which is solved using alternating minimization. The task relationship structure learning component builds on recent advances in structure learning of Gaussian graphical models based on sparse estimators of the precision (inverse covariance) matrix.
