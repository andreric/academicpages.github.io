2017-01-01	Spatial Projection of Multiple Climate Variables Using Hierarchical Multitask Learning	AAAI	This paper proposes a new Hierarchical Multitask Learning framework for the joint prediction of multiple climate variables. Each task in this multitask learning set up is actually another multitask learning problem.	AR Gonçalves, A Banerjee, FJ Von Zuben (2017).

2018-06-01	Modeling Alzheimer's disease cognitive scores using multi-task sparse group lasso	Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics	We consider the problem of simultaneously predicting several different cognitive scores associated with categorizing subjects as normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a multi-task learning framework using features extracted from brain images obtained from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)	X Liu, AR Goncalves, P Cao, D Zhao, A Banerjee (2018) "Modeling Alzheimer's disease cognitive scores using multi-task sparse group lasso" <i>Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics</i>	paper-group-lasso 	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611117301076
2017-09-01 	 On the generalization of fused systems in voice presentation attack detection	16th International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group	This paper describes presentation attack detection systems developed for the Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge (ASVspoof 2017). The submitted systems, using calibration and score fusion techniques, combine different sub-systems (up to 18), which are based on eight state of the art features and rely on Gaussian mixture models and feed-forward neural network classifiers.
