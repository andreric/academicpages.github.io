2017-01-01	Spatial Projection of Multiple Climate Variables Using Hierarchical Multitask Learning	AAAI	This paper proposes a new Hierarchical Multitask Learning framework for the joint prediction of multiple climate variables. Each task in this multitask learning set up is actually another multitask learning problem.	AR Gonçalves, A Banerjee, FJ Von Zuben (2017).
