title: " On the generalization of fused systems in voice presentation attack detection"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-09-01-paper-asvspoof
excerpt: 'This paper describes presentation attack detection systems developed for the Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge (ASVspoof 2017). The submitted systems, using calibration and score fusion techniques, combine different sub-systems (up to 18), which are based on eight state of the art features and rely on Gaussian mixture models and feed-forward neural network classifiers.'

This paper describes presentation attack detection systems developed for the Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge (ASVspoof 2017). The submitted systems, using calibration and score fusion techniques, combine different sub-systems (up to 18), which are based on eight state of the art features and rely on Gaussian mixture models and feed-forward neural network classifiers.
