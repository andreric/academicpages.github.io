The documents below are introductory materials for a variety of machine learning sub-fields. These materials are actually chapters of my undegrad final project that was written back in 2008. Even though these fast-moving research areas, these materials can serve as a first read for those starting in the machine learning realm. All the documents are in (Brazilian) Portuguese.

* [Genetic Algorithms](/files/pdfs/geneticos.pdf) (Algoritmos Genéticos)
* [Bayesian Networks](/files/pdfs/bayesianas.pdf) (Redes Bayesianas)
* [Particle Swarm Optimization](/files/pdfs/enxames.pdf) (Otimização por Enxame de Partículas)
* [Neural Networks](/files/pdfs/redes_neurais.pdf) (Redes Neurais)
* [Support Vector Machine](/files/pdfs/svm.pdf) (Máquina de Vetores Suporte)
