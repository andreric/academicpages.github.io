The documents below are introductory materials for a variety of machine learning sub-fields. These materials are actually chapters of my undegraduate thesis that was written back in 2008. Even though these are fast-moving research areas, these materials can serve as a first read for those starting in the machine learning realm. All the documents are in Brazilian Portuguese.

* [Genetic Algorithms](/files/pdfs/geneticos.pdf) (Algoritmos Genéticos)
* [Bayesian Networks](/files/pdfs/bayesianas.pdf) (Redes Bayesianas)
* [Particle Swarm Optimization](/files/pdfs/enxames.pdf) (Otimização por Enxame de Partículas)
* [Neural Networks](/files/pdfs/redes_neurais.pdf) (Redes Neurais)
* [Support Vector Machine](/files/pdfs/svm.pdf) (Máquina de Vetores Suporte)


The full undergrad thesis can be found [here](/files/pdfs/undegrad_thesis.pdf). If you want to use some of these materials and would like cite it, please use the following citation entry:
