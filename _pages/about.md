I'm a machine learning researcher at the [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov) in Livermore, CA, USA.

I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english) (Unicamp) in Brazil and [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://www.cs.umn.edu), MN, USA, with thesis topic ["Sparse and Structural Multitask Learning"](../files/PhD_Thesis_Andre_R_Goncalves.pdf). My advisors were Prof. Fernando Jos√© Von Zuben (Unicamp) and Prof. Arindam Banerjee (University of Minnesota, Twin Cities).

My main research interests are in multitask learning, deep learning, Bayesian models, sparse models, and convex optimization. I've been studying and applying those techniques on problems from a variety of areas such as climate sciences, Alzheimer's disease progression, cancer survival prediction, and speech signal processing.
