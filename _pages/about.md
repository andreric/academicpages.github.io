Hi! I'm Andre Goncalves.

I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english) (Unicamp), in Brazil, with thesis topic "Sparse and Structural Multitask Learning". My advisors were Dr. Fernando Jos√© Von Zuben (Unicamp) and Dr. Arindam Banerjee (University of Minnesota, Twin Cities). I spent part of my Ph.D studies at University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, MN, USA.

Currently, I'm doing Machine Learning Research at the [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov) in Livermore, CA, USA.
